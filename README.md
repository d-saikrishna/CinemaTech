## Shot division

Every script should be broken down into shots. This is generally done by the director-cinematographer together.

If the script is written in a certain format, we can attempt to create a template that makes the discussion between director and cinematographer simpler.

Script format:
1. Every paragraph should be one shot. Paragraph can be a single line as well.

Ideal:
1. The resulting shot division should be the optimum one. If all the shots are captured, essentially all the actions are captured without any duplication. Director can ofcourse choose duplication on sets for other purposes.
