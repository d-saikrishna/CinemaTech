INT. KITCHEN. DAY FADE IN.

A dustbin is loaded beyond its capacity. Gautam litters more.

Gautam had just woke up and played music on his phone. He is making his coffee. 

Ahalya hugged him from behind. Bags (trolly) still with her.

Gautam: Baby, I missed you. 

And kissed her.

Ahalya: I miss you too.

And hugged him tight.

Still hugging. She saw the pile of waste undisposed. Disappointed.

Ahalya: Gautam I asked you to dispose the dustbin everyday. Looks like you haven’t done it for the week.

She broke the hug and walked towards the dustbin.

Gautam: Arey Sorry Sorry, Let me do this now. 

He rushed towards the dustbin trying to overtake Ahalya.

Ahalya: It’s okay. I’ll do it now. 

Ahalya and Gautam keep overtaking. Ahalya reached the bin and started clearing. She found disposed condom packets.

She held them against him.

Gautam: Baby, I can explain…

Ahalya searched the Kitchen while Gautam was trying to explain and control her.

She took the knife and stabbed him in the chest. 

Blood on her face.

And then stabbed him multiple times in his crotch. Screaming, Crying. Volatile.

She then drew her bag behind her. Sat by it and calmed.

Looked at the dead body. Bloody.

Ahalya collected a cigarette.

Took a long puff and smoked.

Title- AHALYA. (Ahalya and Gautam in frame)

Ahalya put off the cigarette on [Gautam’s]() crotch. And left.

She took the mop and cleaned the floor. 

Disposed it in dustbin

cleared the bin.

Empty bin, with blood stains.

FADE OUT.
